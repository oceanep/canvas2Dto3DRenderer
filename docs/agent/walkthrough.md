# raw2dto3D Project Setup Walkthrough

I have successfully initialized the `raw2dto3D` project using Vite with the Vanilla JS template.

## Changes Made
- Created directory `raw2dto3D`
- Initialized Vite project (Vanilla template)
- Installed dependencies (`npm install`)
- Started development server (`npm run dev`)

## Verification Results
### file Structure
The project structure is as follows:
```
raw2dto3D/
├── package.json (Contains only vite as devDependency)
├── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── main.js
│   ├── style.css
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

### Dev Server
The development server is running at:
- **Local**: `http://localhost:5173/`

You can verify this by opening the URL in your browser. The project supports hot reloading out of the box.
